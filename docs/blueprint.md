# **App Name**: GuardianGate

## Core Features:

- Voice Command Authentication: Allow users to authenticate via a voice command. Initially the user creates and saves a specific audio password using their microphone; each login will require a voice recording, and a tool will compare the recording to the audio password using AI, such as verifying frequency ranges.
- Gesture-Based Authentication: Implement a hand gesture authentication system. Users record a sequence of taps or clicks on specific UI elements which become a secret gesture that must be matched to unlock the app.
- Account Creation: Enable new users to create an account by providing basic details like name, age, and contact number.
- Password Setup: Guide new users through the process of setting up both voice command and hand gesture passwords after account creation.
- Login Attempt Limiter: Limit the number of attempts for both voice command (5 attempts) and hand gesture (3 attempts) authentication methods.
- Feedback Mechanism: Display real-time feedback to the user indicating whether the entered voice command or hand gesture is correct or incorrect. Generate success messages or error notifications, based on user action.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep navy blue (#2C3E50) to convey security and trust.
- Background color: Light grey (#F4F4F8) for a clean, modern interface.

- Modern and intuitive layout with a focus on ease of navigation and a visually appealing interface.
